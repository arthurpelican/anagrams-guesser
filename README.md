# Anagrams Guesser
An anagrams guesser

This program is meant to find, among a certain list of words given in words.txt, the anagram of a string given by the user.

I'm making this program to train myself on files reading using python.

By giving uppercases letters in the word you give, the program will guess your word more efficiently by considering that this is the first letter.
